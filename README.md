### 1. Introduction  
The **Restaurant Revenue Prediction** project aims to predict the revenue generated by restaurants based on various factors such as location, cuisine, customer ratings, and other operational metrics. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its structure, processes, and supporting scripts.

### 2. Dataset Description  
**Dataset Name:** Restaurant Revenue Dataset  

**Description:** The dataset contains 8368 entries and 16 columns, providing various features that can help in predicting restaurant revenue:

- **Location:** The geographical location of the restaurant.
- **Cuisine:** Type of cuisine offered.
- **Rating:** Average customer rating.
- **Seating Capacity:** Number of seats available in the restaurant.
- **Average Meal Price:** The average price of a meal at the restaurant.
- **Marketing Budget:** The budget allocated for marketing activities.
- **Social Media Followers:** Number of followers on social media platforms.
- **Chef Experience Years:** The number of years of experience the head chef has.
- **Number of Reviews:** Total number of reviews received.
- **Avg Review Length:** Average length of reviews provided by customers.
- **Ambience Score:** A score rating the ambience of the restaurant.
- **Service Quality Score:** A score rating the service quality.
- **Parking Availability:** Indicates whether parking is available (Yes/No).
- **Weekend Reservations:** Number of reservations made over the weekend.
- **Weekday Reservations:** Number of reservations made during weekdays.
- **Revenue:** The total revenue generated by the restaurant.

### 3. Project Objectives  
- **Data Ingestion:** Load and explore the dataset.
- **Data Transformation:** Clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models to predict restaurant revenue.
- **Pipeline Creation:** Develop a pipeline for data ingestion, transformation, and model training.
- **Supporting Scripts:** Provide scripts for setup, logging, exception handling, and utilities.

### 5. Data Ingestion  
The data ingestion module loads the restaurant dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and saves them as CSV files. The raw data is stored in the `artifacts/` folder for future reference.

### 6. Data Transformation  
The data transformation module handles data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables (e.g., `Location`, `Cuisine`, `Parking Availability`) and scaling numerical variables (e.g., `Rating`, `Seating Capacity`, `Average Meal Price`, etc.). The transformed data is stored in the `artifacts/` folder.

### 7. Model Training  
The model training module trains multiple machine learning regression models such as:

- Linear Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- ElasticNet  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- AdaBoost Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor
- KNeighbors Regressor

The best-performing model is saved as `best_model.pkl` in the `artifacts/` folder.

### 8. Training Pipeline  
The training pipeline module integrates data ingestion, data transformation, and model training. This ensures that all components are executed in the correct sequence, from loading the data to saving the best model.

### 9. Prediction Pipeline  
The prediction pipeline uses the `best_model.pkl` and the `preprocessor.pkl` to predict restaurant revenue on new data. It handles preprocessing and model inference in a seamless manner.

### 10. Flask (app.py)  
The Flask app (`app.py`) provides a web interface to input restaurant data and receive revenue predictions. The form inputs are collected in `index.html`, and the results are displayed in `results.html`.

### 11. Logging  
The `logger.py` file captures logs of the project execution, including data ingestion, transformation, model training, and errors encountered. The logs are stored in a designated folder for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### 12. Exception Handling  
The `exception.py` file contains the exception handling code, ensuring that any errors in the pipeline are caught and logged. This helps in maintaining the robustness of the project.

### 13. Utils  
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions for various repetitive tasks like directory creation, file management, and data loading.

### 14. Conclusion  
This documentation outlines the complete workflow of the **Restaurant Revenue Prediction** project, covering the ingestion, transformation, and modeling processes. The project's modular structure allows for easy maintenance, scalability, and adaptability, ensuring that it can be extended for various future use cases.
